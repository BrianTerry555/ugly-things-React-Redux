This is a React - Redux app that I created to take a Title, image Url and Desc.
Then load them into a Gallery format then edit and/or save new input within each
gallery image.

I am learning more and more how to manipulate props and pass them from Parent
to child while also using Redux to map them for the parent to use.

Thanks for looking
